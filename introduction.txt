#Brief Introduction About Myself
Hi, I’m Abduraim. I’m a university student and an aspiring entrepreneur driven by a big vision: to build the largest tech company in Africa — something like “Africa’s Google.” I’m currently working with peers on a startup and developing a larger idea focused on Ethiopia’s emerging capital market, aiming to make investing and financial information more accessible to everyone.
I’m especially passionate about tech, innovation, and using digital solutions to solve meaningful problems across the continent.
